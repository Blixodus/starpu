Naming Conventions
------------------

* Prefix names of public objects (types, functions, etc.) with "starpu"

* Prefix names of internal objects (types, functions, etc.) with "_starpu"

* Names for qualified types (struct, union, enum) do not end with _t, _s or similar.
  Use _t only for typedef types, such as opaque public types, e.g
       typedef struct _starpu_data_state* starpu_data_handle_t;
  or
       typedef uint64_t starpu_tag_t;

* When a variable can only take a finite set of values, use an enum
  type instead of defining macros for each of the values.





Style
-----
* curly braces always go on a new line
