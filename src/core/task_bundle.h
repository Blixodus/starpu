 * ==========================
 * Purpose
 * =======
 * Structure describing a list of tasks that should be scheduled on the same
 * worker whenever it's possible.
 * It must be considered as a hint given to the scheduler as there is no guarantee that
 * they will be executed on the same worker.
 *
 * Fields
 * ======
 * mutex		Mutex protecting the structure.
 *
 * list			Array of tasks included in the bundle.
 *
 * closed		Used to know if the user is still willing to
 * 			add/remove some tasks in the bundle. Especially useful for
 * 			the runtime to know whether it is safe to destroy a bundle.
