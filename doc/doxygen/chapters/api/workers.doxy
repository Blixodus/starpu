\def STARPU_NMAXWORKERS
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Define the maximum number of workers managed by StarPU.

\def STARPU_MAXCPUS
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Define the maximum number of CPU workers managed by StarPU. The default value can be modified at
configure by using the option \ref enable-maxcpus "--enable-maxcpus".

\def STARPU_MAXNODES
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Define the maximum number of memory nodes managed by StarPU. The default value can be modified at
configure by using the option \ref enable-maxnodes "--enable-maxnodes". Reducing it allows to
considerably reduce memory used by StarPU data structures.

\struct starpu_worker_collection
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
A scheduling context manages a collection of workers that can
be memorized using different data structures. Thus, a generic
structure is available in order to simplify the choice of its type.
Only the list data structure is available but further data
structures(like tree) implementations are foreseen.

\enum starpu_worker_collection_type
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Types of structures the worker collection can implement
\var starpu_worker_collection_type::STARPU_WORKER_LIST
    The collection is an array
\var starpu_worker_collection_type::STARPU_WORKER_TREE
    The collection is a tree

\struct starpu_sched_ctx_iterator
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Structure needed to iterate on the collection
\var int starpu_sched_ctx_iterator::cursor
    The index of the current worker in the collection, needed when
    iterating on the collection.

\fn unsigned starpu_worker_get_count(void)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the number of workers (i.e. processing units executing StarPU
tasks). The returned value should be at most \ref STARPU_NMAXWORKERS.

\fn int starpu_worker_get_count_by_type(enum starpu_worker_archtype type)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the number of workers of \p type. A positive (or
<c>NULL</c>) value is returned in case of success, <c>-EINVAL</c>
indicates that \p type is not valid otherwise.

\fn unsigned starpu_cpu_worker_get_count(void)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the number of CPUs controlled by StarPU. The returned value should be at most \ref STARPU_MAXCPUS.

\fn unsigned starpu_cuda_worker_get_count(void)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the number of CUDA devices controlled by StarPU. The returned value should be at most \ref STARPU_MAXCUDADEVS.

\fn unsigned starpu_mic_worker_get_count(void)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the number of MIC workers controlled by StarPU.

\fn unsigned starpu_mic_device_get_count(void)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the number of MIC devices controlled by StarPU. The returned value should be at most \ref STARPU_MAXMICDEVS.

\fn unsigned starpu_mpi_ms_worker_get_count(void)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the number of MPI Master Slave workers controlled by StarPU.

\fn unsigned starpu_scc_worker_get_count(void)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the number of SCC devices controlled by StarPU. The returned value should be at most \ref STARPU_MAXSCCDEVS.

\fn unsigned starpu_opencl_worker_get_count(void)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the number of OpenCL devices controlled by StarPU. The returned value should be at most \ref STARPU_MAXOPENCLDEVS.

\fn int starpu_worker_get_id(void)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the identifier of the current worker, i.e the one associated to
the calling thread. The returned value is either -1 if the current
context is not a StarPU worker (i.e. when called from the application
outside a task or a callback), or an integer between 0 and
starpu_worker_get_count() - 1.

\fn unsigned starpu_worker_get_id_check(void)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Similar to starpu_worker_get_id(), but abort when called from outside
a worker (i.e. when starpu_worker_get_id() would return -1).

\fn unsigned starpu_worker_get_ids_by_type(enum starpu_worker_archtype type, int *workerids, unsigned maxsize)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Get the list of identifiers of workers of \p type. Fill the array \p
workerids with the identifiers of the \p workers. The argument \p
maxsize indicates the size of the array \p workerids. The returned
value gives the number of identifiers that were put in the array.
<c>-ERANGE</c> is returned is \p maxsize is lower than the number of workers
with the appropriate type: in that case, the array is filled with the
\p maxsize first elements. To avoid such overflows, the value of maxsize
can be chosen by the means of the function
starpu_worker_get_count_by_type(), or by passing a value greater or
equal to \ref STARPU_NMAXWORKERS.

\fn int starpu_worker_get_by_type(enum starpu_worker_archtype type, int num)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the identifier of the \p num -th worker that has the
specified \p type. If there is no such worker, -1 is returned.

\fn int starpu_worker_get_by_devid(enum starpu_worker_archtype type, int devid)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the identifier of the worker that has the specified \p type
and device id \p devid (which may not be the n-th, if some
devices are skipped for instance). If there is no such worker, -1 is
returned.

\fn int starpu_worker_get_devid(int id)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the device id of the worker \p id. The
worker should be identified with the value returned by the
starpu_worker_get_id() function. In the case of a CUDA worker, this
device identifier is the logical device identifier exposed by CUDA
(used by the function \c cudaGetDevice() for instance). The device
identifier of a CPU worker is the logical identifier of the core on
which the worker was bound; this identifier is either provided by the
OS or by the library <c>hwloc</c> in case it is available.

\fn enum starpu_worker_archtype starpu_worker_get_type(int id)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the type of processing unit associated to the worker \p id. The
worker identifier is a value returned by the function
starpu_worker_get_id()). The returned value indicates the architecture
of the worker: ::STARPU_CPU_WORKER for a CPU core,
::STARPU_CUDA_WORKER for a CUDA device, and ::STARPU_OPENCL_WORKER for
a OpenCL device. The value returned for an invalid identifier is
unspecified.

\fn void starpu_worker_get_name(int id, char *dst, size_t maxlen)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Allow to get the name of the worker \p id. StarPU associates a unique
human readable string to each processing unit. This function copies at
most the \p maxlen first bytes of the unique string associated to the
worker \p id into the \p dst buffer. The caller is responsible for
ensuring that \p dst is a valid pointer to a buffer of \p maxlen bytes
at least. Calling this function on an invalid identifier results in an
unspecified behaviour.

\fn void starpu_worker_display_names(FILE *output, enum starpu_worker_archtype type)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Display on \p output the list (if any) of all the workers of the given
\p type.

\fn unsigned starpu_worker_get_memory_node(unsigned workerid)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the identifier of the memory node associated to the worker
identified by \p workerid.

\fn enum starpu_node_kind starpu_node_get_kind(unsigned node)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return the type of \p node as defined by
::starpu_node_kind. For example, when defining a new data interface,
this function should be used in the allocation function to determine
on which device the memory needs to be allocated.

\fn char *starpu_worker_get_type_as_string(enum starpu_worker_archtype type)
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Return worker \p type as a string.
