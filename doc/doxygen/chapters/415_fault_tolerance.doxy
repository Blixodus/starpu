\section Introduction Introduction

Due to e.g. hardware error, some tasks may fail, or even complete nodes may fail.

\section TaskRetry Retrying tasks

In case a task implementation notices that it fail to compute properly, it can
call starpu_task_failed() to notify StarPU of the failure. StarPU will then
clear the failure and re-execute the task, until an execution succeeds.

This can only work if the task input are not modified, and is thus not supported
for tasks with data access mode ::STARPU_RW.
