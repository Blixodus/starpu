/*! \page StencilApplication A Stencil Application

We show in this chapter how to easily convert an existing application to use StarPU.

\section StencilOriginal The Original Application

\snippet stencil5.c To be included. You should update doxygen if you see this text.

\section StencilStarPU The StarPU Application

The computation function must be defined through a codelet.

\snippet stencil5_starpu.c starpu_codelet. You should update doxygen if you see this text.

Data must be registered to StarPU.

\snippet stencil5_starpu.c starpu_register. You should update doxygen if you see this text.

Instead of directly calling the function, a StarPU task must be created.

\snippet stencil5_starpu.c starpu_task. You should update doxygen if you see this text.

And finally data must be released from StarPU.

\snippet stencil5_starpu.c starpu_unregister. You should update doxygen if you see this text.

The whole StarPU application looks as follows.

\snippet stencil5_starpu.c To be included. You should update doxygen if you see this text.

\section StencilStarPUMPI The StarPU MPI Application

The initialisation for StarPU-MPI is as follows.

\snippet stencil5_starpu_mpi.c mpi_init. You should update doxygen if you see this text.

An additional call to starpu_mpi_data_register() is necessary.

\snippet stencil5_starpu_mpi.c mpi_register. You should update doxygen if you see this text.

And to insert a task, the function starpu_mpi_task_insert() must be used.

\snippet stencil5_starpu_mpi.c mpi_insert. You should update doxygen if you see this text.

The whole StarPU-MPI application looks as follows.

\snippet stencil5_starpu_mpi.c To be included. You should update doxygen if you see this text.
