<ul>
<li> You can learn how to create and run your own StarPU applications after reading Chapter \ref StarPUApplications.
<li> We also explain to you how to implement simple programs that submit tasks to StarPU in Chapter \ref BasicExamples and some complex programs in Part \ref StarPUApplications.
<li> A full source code about scaling a vector is shown in Chapter \ref FullSourceCodeVectorScal.
<li> We introduce the most important and core concepts in StarPU:
    <ul>
    <li> The basic information about how to manage tasks in StarPU is in Chapter \ref TasksInStarPU.
    <li> In Chapter \ref DataManagement, we show you how to manage the data layout of your applications according to different data interfaces provided by StarPU.
    <li> We list basic scheduling policies in StarPU in Chapter \ref Scheduling.
    </ul>
<li> Once you read all contents above, you can try some examples in StarPU sources. The list of example directories is in Chapter \ref ExamplesInStarPUSources.
