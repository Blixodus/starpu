SOCL is an OpenCL implementation based on StarPU. It gives a unified access to
every available OpenCL device: applications can now share entities such as
Events, Contexts or Command Queues between several OpenCL implementations.

In addition, command queues that are created without specifying a device provide
automatic scheduling of the submitted commands on OpenCL devices contained in
the context to which the command queue is attached.

Note: as of StarPU @value{VERSION}, this is still an area under
development and subject to change.
