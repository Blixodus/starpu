Open problems:
	- how to merge cuda/cublas drivers ?
		- driver could take something else than function pointers
		- mix programmer's kernel and cublas functions
	- dealing with MPI ?
		- coarse grain size (MPI) + middle/fine grain locally
	- how to implement a reduction or stencil kernels ?
		- exemples : stencil, life game, SOR
	- what about malleable tasks ?
		- at some point, the task is scheduled onto several core
		- put tasks in a "bag" and schedule them together
			- think of the steady-state problems descriptions
	- Asynchronous MSI
		- biblio ?
		- is it a real problem ?
	- How to let the programmer model cost ?
		- identical tasks
		- well known BLAS (size based cost)
		- fully irregular (eg. data mining)
	- What about out-of-core computations ?
		- really take a COMA approach ?
	- How should the programmer express its scheduling requirements ?
		- at compile time ?
			- application specific tailored schedulers
			- equivalent to some static scheduling if this is a 
			  steady state problem..
		- scheduling policy ?
		- task graph = none, tree, DAG ?
	- What about typed tasks ?
		- priority
		- static scheduler = type A + type B then type C etc...

Application domains
	- Dense linear algebra
		- LU decomposition (ok ...)
		- Cholesky, QR, ...
	- Sparse Linear algebra
		- PastiX
		- SuperLU
		- Sparse matrix-vector multiplication dummy example
	- n-body problems
		- particle-particle (O(n^2))
		- Barnes-Hut -> handling trees ?
		- Fast Multipole Method
	- Signal Processing 
		- Multimedia kernels
			- cf Scalp apps ?
			- stencils
			- life game
		- FFT
			- some kernel filters ?
		- data compression
			- mpeg decoder (Scalp)
		- data reconstruction from tomography ??
	- Graph theory
		- ASP
		- TSP
	- Data Mining
		- replace Linda in DigDag ;)
	- Logic, Formal algebra
		- cf Evora ?
	- ProHMPT ANR ...

TODO:
	- htable
		- lock free
		- *deallocation !*
	- performance comparision:
		- multithreaded MKL ?
	- external libs
		- linked with a dummy BLAS lib ?
	- dynamically compiling apps makes sense ?
		- apps only use codelets + the main does weird stuff
		- drivers only call pop/push
