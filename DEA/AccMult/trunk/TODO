Open problems:
	- dealing with MPI ?
		- coarse grain size (MPI) + middle/fine grain locally
	- how to implement a reduction or stencil kernels ?
		- exemples : stencil, life game, SOR
	- what about malleable tasks ?
		- at some point, the task is scheduled onto several core
		- put tasks in a "bag" and schedule them together
			- think of the steady-state problems descriptions
	- Asynchronous MSI
		- biblio ?
		- is it a real problem ?
	- How to let the programmer model cost ?
		- identical tasks : for debugging only ?
		- well known BLAS (size based cost)
		- fully irregular (eg. data mining)
		- interface for cost modeling ?
		- per worker queue without work-stealing ?
			- see effects on the dw_mult pathological cases
		- deduction for the granularity indications to the apps ?
	- What about out-of-core computations ?
		- really take a COMA approach ?
	- How should the programmer express its scheduling requirements ?
		- at compile time ?
			- application specific tailored schedulers
			- equivalent to some static scheduling if this is a 
			  steady state problem..
		- scheduling policy ?
		- task graph = none, tree, DAG ?
	- What about typed tasks ?
		- priority
		- static scheduler = type A + type B then type C etc...
	- Use textures for the read-only data types
		- eg : CSR matrices !
		- should help with the unaligned access patterns
	- Policies
		- single list multi-level priorities
